# Welcome to SACS Study
##This is an open source website
The code and folder layout is ULTRA messy, but it will be fixed sometime that is not today.
Feel free to leave an issue!

Looking for Mods to help maintain the site. It's okay if you know nothing about html, I'm willing to teach you the basics. (It's really easy and fun!)
